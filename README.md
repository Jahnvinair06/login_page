This is my first git project

## Demo Login Page

Files:
- `index.html` — main page with the login form
- `styles.css` — styling for the page
- `script.js` — client-side validation and mock auth

How to open:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file).

- Or run a simple local HTTP server from this folder (recommended):

PowerShell (Windows):
```
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Notes:
- This is a front-end demo only — authentication is mocked on the client.
- For production, implement secure server-side authentication and HTTPS.
